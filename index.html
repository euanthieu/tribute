        <ul>
          <li> After the Treaty of Paris which ended Spain's dominion over the Philippines, the Americans came up to Baguio and took possession of land disregarding any claim of ownership from its settlers.</li>
          
            <li>Cariño filed a petition in the Court of Land Registration praying that there be granted to him title</li>

            <strong>G.R. No. 2869 Mateo Cariño vs. The Insular Government</strong>

        <li>The lower court and the Philippine Supreme Court, which is still under American control, denied said petition. <strong>The case reached the U.S.A.</strong></li>


           <li>Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, one of the most widely cited United States Supreme Court justices in history, <strong>ruled in Cariño's favor,</strong> in a decision promulgated on the 23rd of February, 1909.</li>

 <li>The Court upheld as valid a claim of land ownership hinged upon tribal custom and tribal recognition of ownership. <strong>"The land belonged to Cariño under the Igorot law. He had inherited it from his ancestors in accordance with the native customs and his title had never been questioned.</strong>
 </li>
           
    <strong>THE CARINO DOCTRINCE</strong>
     <li>The case became known to be the Carino Doctrine becase a title was formed named, <strong>"Native Title"</strong> property rights are to be administered for the benefit of the inhabitants, one who actually owned land for many years
 </li>

 <li>This gave hope for all land to be rightfully own by the right people</li>

<br>

          <p><em>
            "The landmark decision gave rise to what is now known as the "Cariño Doctrine" and it has far reaching implications that benefited not only the Indigenous Peoples in the Philippines but also the native communities in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and elsewhere. Courts around the globe continue to cite this jurisprudence in protecting the rights and interests of the original inhabitants of a certain territory. Though Cariño didn't live to see the fruits of his remarkable fortitude, his bravery in daring to challenge the Americans brought hope for all Indigenous Peoples of the world who are struggling to regain ownership or seek recognition of lands that are rightfully theirs."</em>
